# Call-Center-Data-Analysis-Dashboard

# Overview
I recently had the opportunity to analyze call center performance data, leveraging Power BI for visualization. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into my process and the insights I uncovered:


Step 1: Data Preparation
Before diving into analysis, I ensured the dataset was clean and ready for visualization. This step was crucial for accurate analysis and smooth integration into Power BI.


Step 2: Key Metrics and Insights
Using Power BI, I created an interactive dashboard highlighting key metrics such as:


a)Average Satisfaction Rate: Tracks overall customer satisfaction.
b)Average Speed of Answer: Measures how quickly calls are answered.
c)Average Talk Time: Indicates the average duration of calls.
d)Satisfaction Rating by Agent: Shows individual agent performance.
e)Call Count by Month: Provides a monthly breakdown of call volumes.
f)Resolved Calls by Topic: Breaks down call resolution by categories like contract-related, streaming, and technical support.


# Key Insights


a)Agent Performance: Jim has the highest number of answered calls and satisfaction ratings, indicating strong performance.
b)Call Resolution: Streaming and technical support are the most common issues resolved.
c)Monthly Trends: Call volumes remain stable with minor fluctuations.


# Recommendations


a)Training: Provide additional training for agents with lower satisfaction ratings.
b)Resource Allocation: Ensure adequate staffing during peak call times.
c)Process Improvement: Streamline processes for common issues to reduce talk time.


This project was a fantastic opportunity to showcase my Power BI skills and deliver actionable insights. The dashboard not only looks great but also provides valuable information for decision-making.
